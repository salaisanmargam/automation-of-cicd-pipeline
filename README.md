Project Overview:

Modern software systems require frequent updates, fast delivery, and high reliability. However, traditional manual deployment approaches are error-prone, time-consuming, and lack visibility into system performance.

This project focuses on designing and implementing an automated CI/CD pipeline integrated with cloud-based monitoring, using a real-world web application as a validation system. The primary objective is to demonstrate deployment automation, testing automation, containerization, and observability, rather than application functionality alone.

 Problem Statement

Manual software deployment processes suffer from:

High dependency on human intervention

Deployment failures due to configuration inconsistencies

Absence of automated testing before deployment

No real-time monitoring of deployed applications

As applications scale, these issues result in unreliable software delivery and operational inefficiencies. There is a strong need for an automated, monitored, and reproducible deployment pipeline.

💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes a CI/CD-driven deployment architecture where:

Code changes automatically trigger build and test processes

Applications are containerized for environment consistency

Deployment is automated using CI/CD pipelines

System performance and availability are monitored in real time

A web-based application is used as a real-world deployment target to validate the pipeline.
